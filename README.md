Specifications:
1. This is an individual assignment. You will work on this assignment by yourself.
2. Please use any computer language (but not Java, C, or C++, and it is recommended that you
choose a language you know nothing about it yet.) to create a program to do the following:
a. Open and read from the data file, “COSC450_P2_Data.txt”, which contains some
number of integer values (separated by white space character(s)) with the number of
integers a multiple of 10. A sample “COSC450_P2_Data.txt” file will be given to you but
your program should be able to process any “COSC450_P2_Data.txt” file with the above
property.
b. After read in the data file your program will process the integer values into two matrixes
(stored in two dimension arrays): the first one with the dimension 5 * X and the second
one X * 5, where X is some value determined by the number of integers in the input
data file.
c. Output the above two matrixes into an output file, “COSC450_P2_Output.txt”, created
by your program.
d. Calculate a product matrix (a two-dimension array of long integers) based on the first
matrix multiplies the second matrix;
e. Write the product matrix out to the same output file, “COSC450_P2_Output.txt”, by
appending it to the end;
f. Bonus points for undergraduates (10 points) and required for graduates: sort the
product matrix and append it to the end of the above output file,
“COSC450_P2_Output.txt”. Your sorting cannot be done by copy the values out from
the matrix into a single dimension array then put it back but has to be done on the
matrix directly by manipulating the subscripts correctly.
Deliverables:
1. Submit your source code file(s) to the Blackboard before the due time.
2. Screen shot and paste the output in a word document, and submit it on blackboard.
Grading:
1. Total 100 points, excluding the 10 bonus points for undergraduates.
